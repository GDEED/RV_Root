  name: "Chris"
  surname: "Lowery"
  company: "Fasility"
  title: "Developer"
  bio: "I'm head of User Experience at Fasility. My focus is on maximizing the experience that can be delivered through a typical smartphone or tablet, extending upwards to Vive and Oculus with the same codebase. I research device capabilities, sensor fusion, heterogeneous processing, and augmented reality. Lately I have mentored folks from artistic backgrounds to help them seize the means of production in XR. Seeing someone take off with running code in their hand is strangely more satisfying than doing it myself."
