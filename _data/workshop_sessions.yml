  title: "XR at the speed of Web. Publish or perish in 10 minutes or less"
  description: "A-Frame, Glitch, ShaderFrog, Sketchfab and Google Poly let you develop, collaborate on, and publish worlds in a short time. Learn how to amaze people fast, and give them the tools to amaze others.
WebVR offers a different working and publishing flow than a Unity or Unreal project. There are massive downsides and upsides. The two worlds can intermix very fluidly. That and more in the workshop."

  title: "Defense Against the Dark VR Arts: 3D Interaction Design for VR"
  description: "Virtual reality (VR) has become a new form of human-computer interaction, which is often attributed “magical” powers. With the numerous potential uses and applications of VR comes a multitude of challenges with respect to user experience and interaction design. The wizards of the VR world (aka VR designers and developers) need to consider these challenges when deciding on the interaction paradigms to be used in their VR apps, so as not to inflict poor VR experiences on the Muggles of the VR world (aka users). Designed with the VR Muggles in mind, this workshop provides an overview of common 3D interaction paradigms for VR and highlights evidence-based best practices in the design and development of various aspects of 3D interaction in virtual environments, including selection, manipulation, travel, and system control.

  title: "Cross platform VR Development with Unity and VIU"
  description: "This hands on lecture and workshop will show you how to get started with Unity and the Vive Input Utility (VIU) Unity plugin for developing VR that will work across many of the current and upcoming HMDs. Even if you are a seasoned developer we will cover advanced topics like managing input devices, porting from PC to mobile and also visit best practices from http://xra.org
 
We'll be focusing on developing for the Vive/Vive Pro as well as the Vive Focus (Wave platform) but using VIU you will be able to target over a dozen PC and mobile VR devices (and not just Vive devices). To prepare you can take a look at the following blog, https://community.viveport.com/t5/Developer-Blog/bg-p/devblog and also visit http://developer.vive.com for additional resources. If attending please arrive with the Unity 2018.2 (and the Android development tools for Unity) already installed."

  description: "Autodesk Forge is a cloud platform for web developers that allow you to easily translate and view CAD and 3D data. In addition to the Forge Viewer’s capability for WebVR, Autodesk also has a toolkit in beta, that allows a similar workflow into Unity which then allows publishing the interactive experience to many of the popular AR and VR devices on the market today. This class will give an introduction to the Forge web services including the viewer’s WebVR functionality, and the Forge Unity toolkit. After the workshop, you will be able to translate your own 3D assets and use them via the Forge workflow into Unity."
