  title: "XR at the speed of Web. Publish or perish in 10 minutes or less"
  description: "A-Frame, Glitch, ShaderFrog, Sketchfab and Google Poly let you develop, collaborate on, and publish worlds in a short time. Learn how to amaze people fast, and give them the tools to amaze others.
WebVR offers a different working and publishing flow than a Unity or Unreal project. There are massive downsides and upsides. The two worlds can intermix very fluidly. That and more in the workshop."

  title: "Unity Workshop: Working with Packages, SDKs, and APIs"
  description: "**Please bring a laptop with the latest version of Unity installed--installing can take up to 40 minutes otherwise*** A great concept or experience does not always rely on being able to code or 3D model but the integration of tools. For mixed-reality experiences there are already standard pre-packaged tools that teams can use to develop their experiences. In this workshop, we will build a mini experience using no programming or modeling. We will build upon the fundamentals of Unity and introduce how to call APIs, import packages and SDKs from third-party developers and how to install and manage SDKs.. We will cover browsing and importing assets from Google Poly, Vuforia, Mapbox, and other toolkits.  This workshop is geared for both developers and creatives of all experience levels. We will also provide a copy of the IBM Watson SDK which is no longer publicly available. "

  title: "Defense Against the Dark VR Arts: 3D Interaction Design for VR"
  description: "Virtual reality (VR) has become a new form of human-computer interaction, which is often attributed “magical” powers. With the numerous potential uses and applications of VR comes a multitude of challenges with respect to user experience and interaction design. The wizards of the VR world (aka VR designers and developers) need to consider these challenges when deciding on the interaction paradigms to be used in their VR apps, so as not to inflict poor VR experiences on the Muggles of the VR world (aka users). Designed with the VR Muggles in mind, this workshop provides an overview of common 3D interaction paradigms for VR and highlights evidence-based best practices in the design and development of various aspects of 3D interaction in virtual environments, including selection, manipulation, travel, and system control.

  title: "Cross platform VR Development with Unity and VIU"
  description: "This hands on lecture and workshop will show you how to get started with Unity and the Vive Input Utility (VIU) Unity plugin for developing VR that will work across many of the current and upcoming HMDs. Even if you are a seasoned developer we will cover advanced topics like managing input devices, porting from PC to mobile and also visit best practices from http://xra.org. We'll be focusing on developing for the Vive/Vive Pro as well as the Vive Focus (Wave platform) but using VIU you will be able to target over a dozen PC and mobile VR devices (and not just Vive devices). To prepare you can take a look at the following blog, https://community.viveport.com/t5/Developer-Blog/bg-p/devblog and also visit http://developer.vive.com for additional resources. If attending please arrive with the Unity 2018.2 (and the Android development tools for Unity) already installed."

Everybody thinks Apple will come out with the Next Mass Innovation - beautiful AR-enabling glasses - sometime. The excitement we see today with ARCore and ARKit apps is just the first stepping stone.  So what will the future look like? Will websites go away? Will you have to code for iOS or Android to compete, meet and greet in 2020?  In a word, no. More words at the workshop."
