Networking with new people, and exposure to new ideas and skill-building workshops set the stage for impassioned individuals to fuse into teams, with each team sharing a common vision to implement an impactful, original idea. The distillation of the approximately 400 unaffiliated people into teams of up to five individuals produces a creative dynamic, resulting in unique applications of immersive technologies to create ingenious, never-before-seen XR experiences and applications"

  text: "If the Reality, Virtually Hackathon holds true to past events, it will have life-changing impact. For example, Gautham Pasupuleti, a 2017 participant, developed his winning submission into a UNICEF-supported pediatric eye care and healthcare project for under-resourced geographies. Two-time hackathon winner Jackie Assar joined Google’s hardware team along with her teammate Anish Dhesikan, who is now a software engineer on the Google AR team. Companies formed from winning teams, such as 2016 winner Waypoint RX, have gone on to be acquired (Waypoint was recently acquired by PTC.)"
